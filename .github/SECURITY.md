Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Never report any security vulnerability in any public channel, e.g. 
GitHub issue tracker, social medias and so on.

If you discover a security vulnerability within Laravel I18n, 
please report them privately to the maintainer. All security 
vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
