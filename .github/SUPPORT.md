Support Policy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software is compatible with the following Laravel & PHP versions 
and will be supported for a period of time:

| I18n Version | Laravel Version | PHP Version | Bug Fixes Until  | Security Fixes Until |
|:-------------|:----------------| :---------- |:-----------------| :------------------- |
| `1.x`        | `10.x`          | `8.1` | August 6th, 2024 | February 4th, 2025 |

We can not ensure consistent bug & security fixes. Off course, we 
try as hard as we can to close the gaps as soon as we can, but 
real life and a job makes it sometimes difficult to manage everything.
Please respect that and hang on tight.
